* You can now enable XP_Cmdshell if its turned off *woot*
* Fixed SQLite3 from not extracting in the right directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added an auto-update module when you open Fast-Track so it auto-updates upon entering!
* Fixed some spelling goofs and slimmed down the intro text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Removed the Kismet update, can't get it to compile right at this point..Will add when I get more time.
* Changed the Milw0rm update to call the update-milw0rm script in the /pentest/exploits/ directory.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added WinExe installation on main menu as well as "Spawn Command Shell" in the internal menu..
* It's pretty slick, just enter your username, ip, and pw, and you have a full shell on the box.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added a small FTP brute forcer, its not threaded yet, will work on that later
* Added some more description to the WinExe section that I added in version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed some small stuff, moved the changelog menu around
* Fixed a couple issues with FTP brute
* Removed the Update FastTrack menu in the Update Menu..no need for it now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Big changes in this one guys..Added an auto sql injector, check out the external
menu for more information. Basically, enter a url thats susceptible, load up an ftp
server, and have netcat listen on a specific port and it drops a shell for ya. Don't
need to install anything for this one, uses built in python libs for everything.
* I also added in a module that sets up everything for you...All you need to do is install
ProFTPD from the install menu and watch it go.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Cleaned up some of the code, killed like 30 lines, made it look better
* Added Control-C to previous menu option, just hit Control C and it'll
bring you back to the previous menu.
* Added four more passwords for the "quick brute" option in the SQL 1433
brute forcer
* Broke out the Help/Creds and added a TON of new tutorials in the tutorial
menu on how to use this thing! Check it out!!!
* Wow, Fast-Track is 1500+ lines of code now, who would have ever thought?!
* Added an "exploits" menu...plan on adding a lot of exploits through here
eventually...its kinda small atm, will add more later.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Moved the auto-update feature to the menu now, no longer updates when
first starting Fast-Track.
* Slimmed down the Metasploit Automation questions, defaults to sqlite3.
* Removed check for update on Metasploit, can do that through update menu.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Wow it works! Added binary payload delivery for the SQL Injector..Fast-Track
now uploads a reverse shell through an actual HTTP request now instead of relying
off of FTP to transfer a from our server. I kept the FTP portion in there incase
anyone still needed to use that specific function or for some reason the binary
upload wasn't working, but this new addition rocks!
* Broke everything up into multiple menus in SQL Injector, now has four different
menues ranging from binary payload auto, ftp auto, binary payload manual, ftp manual,
and string generator.
* Fixed a small bug in auto update.
* Changed a few issues with the FTP brute forcer
* Cleaned up some code
* Changed the wordlist brute forcer for SQL to use rstrip() instead of [:-1] in case of
spaces. Much more efficient and was causing inconsistencies with wordlists that had
spaces at the end of them.
* Changed some menu handling
* Changed the mass brute forcer in SQL to add a couple more passwords
* Changed some stuff in the service menu that was messed up
* Changed some of the tutorials to reflect changes
* Added a "mass" option in the sql brute forcer, you can now scan any subnet you want
and run brute force attacks with dictionaries on them automatically. As soon as one 
successfully is brute forced, it jumps you right into a shell. Nice!!
* Fixed where you couldn't enter /cidr notations in the ip ranges in the sql brute forcer,
you can now specify 192.168.1.1/16 or /24, or whatever.
* Added it so when you do the mass wordlist brute, or the small wordlist brute, it
automatically spawns you a shell if guessed, no longer have to go to the seperate menu
to enter the shell.
* Cleaned up the small sql brute quite a bit
* Cleaned up some of the "look and feel" on the menus
* Added a return to previous menu in the exploits section
* This really should be a new release with all the changes/additions, but for now going
to release it as 1.9 and not 2.0 yet until it goes through bug testing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Another big update!
* Changed slapt-get to 0.9.10.e, should install fine now (thanks Nate)
* Added an update to Nikto plugins (requested)
* Bug fixes from previous version, fixed couple issues on mass brute
* Re-Arranged the update menu a bit..Fast-Track should naturally be 1 right? :P
* Added a binary to hex copy and paste generator in the external menu..just copy and paste
the output into a windows shell and it'll create a reverse.exe for ya..obviously need your
own executable reverse payload...
* Also added a binary to hex copy and paste generator for Illwill's reverse command shell. 
Its an extremely small executable (checked thoroughly, its clean).. Check the tutorial for
more information.
* Fixed a couple small bugs with the binary to hex binary payload injection where it wasn't
renaming the file properly on some operating systems.
* Removed portions of the tool from mkdir reports, got annoying to see directory already exists, 
etc.
* Added updater for W3AF (Web Application Attack and Audit Framework)
* Broke out the update menu in fast-track, the first screen is updates only, there is now
an installation sub-menu in updates...
* Added "Install Everything" menu, can do bulk install of everything if you want, don't 
need to install each individual one anymore.
* Added "Update Everything" menu, update metasploit, aircrack, nikto, w3af, and milw0rm
with a touch of a button...Does not install all the prereqs, thats what the install menu
is for..
* Added db_destroy pentest for autopwn (thanks n3cre0)
* Added an about menu...just some more info and stuff
* Added a tutorial for Binary to Hex payload generator
* Since its compiled, ./fast-track.py no longer works, so in order to fix this without
hosing everyones start menu and creating mass-chaos...I created a new fast-track.py that
pulls fast-track.pyc if its not there. So fast-track.py is now just a launcher, and 
fast-track.pyc is actually Fast-Track now..If you want to run it straight for some
reason just type python fast-track.pyc. Everything will work fine by still launching
./fast-track.py, no worries. Theres also a README about Fast-Track now in the /pentest/misc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed a small bug on the "Update everything" for the Fast-Track update..
* Added more of a description on the autopwn section on using other
commands for NMAP like -PN, -P0, -v etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Upgraded install PExpect to version 2.3
* Fixed some binary payload issues with the SQL Injector
* Fixed SQL Injector FTP..strange bugs with PEXPECT..workaround
found and fixed.
* Added anti-virus disabling on the binary payload injector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added some more anti-virus disables
* Sped up the time on FTP Injector + Binary Payload Injector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated to include SQLMap in the updates menu, nice tool for extracting tables on various
platforms.
* Took out the prompt for correct IP address in the SQL Injectors..if the IP address isn't
right, then use the manual inject.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Completely redid the binary to hex "Your own" portion, more stable and puts in restrictions
if filesize is over 64kb.
* Added more description around the Metasploit Autopwn to make sure I didn't violate any 
licensing agreements!
* Redid the auto update stuff, now it only downloads a md5.txt file to compare if updates
are ready.
* Read the new licensing agreement about modifying fast-track and such
* Decided to reopen the source up with some limited licensing... feel free to make modifations
just notify me and get approval for public releases of the code...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Came up with a kinda cool concept, check out the tutorials and look under the "Mass Client-
Side attacks"... Theres a new tool under External Hacking...Basically its simple, launches
a ton of metasploit client-side attacks on different ports, starts apache, and loads a new
index.html file embedded with iframes with the correlating metasploit client side ports. When
someone connects to your web server, it launches a slew of exploits against them.
* Added a binary to hex payload generator tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* As you can tell, theres been a lot of changes... Got bored at an airport and wrote some nifty
stuff. First thing, theres now a command line interface and a menu driven interface, when loading
Fast-Track, type ./fast-track -i for interactive mode (menu) and -c for command prompt.
* I split up all the menus into separate files and import them as modules now, this is done for more
modularity and make it start looking like a real program here.
* Added the Metasploit Autopwn, SQL Injector, Binary to Hex Gen, remote command shell and SQL Bruter 
so far to the command line, as time goes on, I'll convert the other tools as well.
* Fixed a bug with sql bruter where it calls os.popen and doesn't have enough time to close the
file and may miss the first password attempt if not properly closed. Added a time lag in there to fix
the issue, tested and works as it should now.
* Fast-Track is now going to be distributed in the form of a tarball and md5's done based on that. 
* Rewrote some of the update script to pull the tarball now instead of individual files
* Added psyco binary optimization, did some benchmarking, looks like it increases menu loading by
twelve percent, not bad.
* The Metasploit Mass Client attack has been rewritten a bit and does everything within msfconsole
(thanks HDM for the help) and is much more efficent.
* Changed the SVN on aircrack-ng repository to the latest
* Added Metasploit Mass Client Attack to the command line
* Fixed two minor bugs with mass client attack
* Fixed a minor bug in the binary payload injector that caused an internal server error on the
victim site
* Sped up the binary payload injection by ten seconds
* Shaved about 600 lines off of the sql brute forcer!! wayyyyyyyyyyyyy more efficient now...wrote
the initial sql bruter when I was first started writing this...always cringed when looking back 
at it :P
* Wow! It's done..finished the Fast-Track web front-end GUI....You can run the GUI by specifying the 
-g (./fast-track.py -g). It boots on localhost port 44444, so fire up a browser and take a peek!!
* Added most of the tools to the web front end, its kind of a plane looking 
front end right now...Plan on spicing it up a bit.
* Added a dependency check when loading the Fast-Track GUI to check for proper modules to run the
tools on Fast-Track..will let you know which ones your missing and which ones you need to install..
* In the SQL Injector tools, I added a timeout if you aren't connected to the internet and have to
specify an IP address if not connected to the internet instead of not working at all.
* Recoded the Mass Client Attack to use the BaseHTTPServer module in python instead of relying off
of Apache to launch the attacks, much more efficient and keeps the dependencies for other third
party apps to a minimal.
* I added a dependency check when you load the FTGUI, Menu, or Command line mode, it checks for
PYMMSQL, PEXPECT, and Psyco modules, if your missing it will prompt you to install it if you 
wish. It does NOT check for ProFTP, WinEXE, or SQLite3.
* Created a setup.py file for initial install for Fast-Track, if you want to port Fast-Track
to something other than Back|Track, this should help you..additionally, it installs the
required dependancies for you.
* Fast-Track now has configuration files for defining the metasploit path, run setup.py
to define the metasploit path, if you don't it will use the standard /pentest/exploits/
framework3/ as the metasploit folder.
* Changed the changelog in menus/gui to pull from the changelog.txt under readme instead of
hard-coding it.
* Rewrote the mass client attack and autopwn in both menu and commandline to reflect the
configuration file changes during setup.
* Added Mass Client Attack to Web GUI.
* Added tutorials to Web GUI.
* Changed/Added the credits in menus and gui to pull from the credits.txt under readme instead
of hard-coding it.
* Fast-Track, around 5000 lines now, wow!
* Added descriptions to each tool on the Web GUI.
* Modified the binary to hex payload generator to output better paste results
* Added a -g <portnum> flag to specify your own port number when launching Fast-Track Web GUI
* More exciting news, with some help from Leroy, got the autoform post to work, just enter a
website and it will identify all forms on that page and automatically try SQL injection on 
each one and give you a command shell. New library called ClientForm required.
* Added the ClientForm module to dependency check in GUI, Menu, and Commandline. Additionally
added it to the installation menu under menu mode.
* Updated Installation SQLite 3.5.1 to 3.5.7 (latest)
* Removed WinEXE installation, takes FOREVER to compile, you can go to the installation menu in
menu mode and do it if you want. Only thing your loosing is the remote shell capability with
user creds.
* Added Muts latest HP Openview NNM Exploit to the Exploits Menu
* Added the Exploits menu to command line, and moved all exploits to the exploits folder and have
both the command line and menu import the exploits instead of having to code them seperately for
each one.
* Added the Exploits menu to the web gui.
* Added Update Metasploit under Menu Mode Autopwn Section and under the Fast-Track Autopwn Web GUI.
(thanks Phoenix)
* Fixed the config.txt error in updating Nikto (thanks theprez)
* Added the config file during initial setup to the overall metasploit path for updating.
* Fixed an issue in web gui where it did not allow cidr notation (thanks pure|hate)
* Fixed the warning messages when using web GUI and on the command line (thanks muts)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed the updating continious cycle loop bug
* Added a detection in setup.py for Ubuntu, will install fine on Ubuntu now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed update everything would still try to update everything with no inet connection
* Added an "Update Fast-Track Only" on command line and web gui
* Added a check to make sure FT is running as root, if not it will exit
* Added a "Return to Previous Menu" in the interactive mode Metasploit autopwn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Rewrote huge portions of the SQL Bruter, it now detects all vulnerable servers within a subnet and
allows you to jump between various shells that it identified instead of one at a time. This is pretty
sweet and is similar to the autopwn feature that allows you to have multiple shells and jump between
them.
* I've started to create one central repository for both the command line mode and menu mode so there
isn't two seperate code sets for each, makes things alot easier for me and more conform through the
entire application.
* Ran into a client that had SQL Server 2005, by default the xp_cmdshell stored proc is turned off. I 
added a custom attack that if SQL Server 2005 is detected and the XP_Cmdshell is turned off, it will
automatically detect and re-enable it for you automatically. Prettttttttttttty slick.
* Updated SQLite3 to 3.5.9 instead of 3.5.7
* Fixed a small issue in setup.py when not detecting clientforms properly
* Removed Milw0rm updating since its taken out in BT3
* Fixed W3AF svn updating, it does W3AF a svn co and then svn update now
* Rewrote a bit in the menu mode updates menu to pull from a central location for updates
* Rewrote the Installation menu to run setup.py install instead of custom code
* Updated Slapt-Get to 0.9.12.d
* Rewrote update script to not delete the metasploit config path file when updating
* Removed WinEXE from Fast-Track, to much of a pain and buggy, may include later
* Fixed Binary to Hex Payload, it wasn't loading the text file properly
* Fixed a small bug where it would state "active.txt" not found when running update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Some major updates, two of the guys here from SecureState "Leroy" and "Sasquatch"  and myself wrote 
some pretty awesome stuff and added a new tool called SQLPwnage. It's pretty amazing, auto crawl an 
entire site or subnet, identify SQL Injection, both error based and blind based, and drop a payload. 
Even better, we bypass the debug 64kb limit by dropping a tiny payload that is essentially just a straight
hex to raw binary converter that allows us to bypass the filesize limit we ran into before. So now theres 
multiple payloads i.e. Metasploit reverse tcp VNC Injection, Meterpreter, our own newly customized Reverse 
TCP Payload which has a custom packer by Whipsmack of SecureState and doesn't get picked up by AV yet, all 
through SQL Injection.  It has been added to all menus,  including the web GUI. This is the tool we are demoing
at Defcon and not releasing until after. So if your reading this, its in the future!
* Just note that SQLPwnage is SUPER buggy, we have spent a long time developing this but it still may have
massive bugs. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed keyboard interrupt errors when crawling in SQLPwnage
* Fixed major bug when converting using debug
* Rewrote how the web front-end handles menus and displays it
dynamically now so I don't have to manually go through each web
page and change the menus when I add a new tool. 
* Converted menu mode autopwn to use ftsrc centralized source code
* Converted SQL Injector Binary Payload Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Converted SQL FTP Payload Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Converted SQL Manual Setup Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Converted SQL Injector Binary Payload POST Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Converted Metasploit Mass Client Attack Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Converted BinaryPayloadGen Menu Mode to centralized source code
* Set Socket Connect timeouts when trying to get interface IP address to 2 seconds
instead of default 15 seconds.
* Set H2B 64KB Bypass and Payload Delivery through SQLInjector to split chunks every
100 chars to fix GET methods when attacking form parameters.
* Added a breakpoint after exploitation for cleanup in SQLPwnage
* Rewrote changelog in web gui to dynamically pull changes from changelog.txt in README
instead of having to enter in two spots.
* Update script extracts tarball into a fasttrack folder instead of extracting all
files inside the same folder.
* Fixed a small error message in SQLPwnage when files were not there
* Fixed version info in setup.py for pymills 3.4, thanks jgor!
* Removed the update script from extracting to a different folder, people had issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Changed dependency check to include PyMills and BeautifulSoup
* Added BeautifulSoup installation to setup.py install script
* Changed setup.py install script around a bit, cleaned it up, etc.
* Added a dependency check on SQLPwnage to check for PyMills and BeautifulSoup or it will exit.
* Changed some things around in SQLPwnage, added some more information.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Removed the killing of anti-virus during SQL Injection, all of our attacks get past any AV
anyways so no need to kill something that doesn't block us ;)
* Fixed a bug with SQL Bruter if the IP address was completely full  like 192.168.233.232 it would
attack .23 instead of .232.
* Fixed a bug where SQL Bruter would display a blank "sa" account twice, in the small brute
force list I had two spaces specified instead of one.
* Fixed a bug in SQLPwnage where strange characters being passed in the URL field would cause
SQLPwange to crash and throw an exception. 
* Fixed a bug in SQLPwnage where unhandled parameters would cause an exception string error and
cause SQLPwnage to crash.
* Added some cool stuff with the Metasploit Mass Client Attack, added payloads so you can now
specify meterpreter, reverse vnc injects, reverse tcp shells, and bind shells, really cool stuff.
Its all in the interactive mode, command line mode and web gui now, enjoy and test out.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed an UnIndexed Error exception in SQLPwnage that would cause a crash.
* Fixed once SQLPwnage was finished in menu mode, by hitting enter, would cause Fast-Track to hang.
* Fixed in menu mode where if you ran one of the tools in the menu, you would have to exit out and
restart Fast-Track to use the same tool again. 
* Added better error handling in SQLPwnage
* Fixed in SQL Bruter where if no SQL Servers were found, it would exit the menu mode completely and
the user would be required to restart Fast-Track.
* Cleaned up menu mode some more and moved some code to centralized ftsrc library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Well, considering this a major revision since I added Ettercap custom filters to the mass client
attack. You can now specify if you want to poison a specific victim, when they go to a site, it
replaces all hrefs and when they click a link it launches a slew of exploits at the victim. Its 
pretty slick. Special thanks to "BigMac" from the remote-exploit forum, he did all the hard work, 
I just incorporated it into this.
* Added the Ettercap Mass Client Attack to interactive, command line, and GUI mode.
* Beware, it may be a little bit buggy, I scratch coded this after getting back from a poker game
and a few beers, I'll clean everything up next release.
* Added a quick ftgui executable, simply ./ftgui and you should be rocking and rolling in the
Fast-Track gui in the root folder. 
* Changed the licensing agreement, thanks HDM for turning me to the dark side on the licensing ;)
Fast-Track now uses the BSD licensing for everything.
* Changed the main index page around a little bit.
* Added an apt-get install for ettercap in the setup.py file, only for Ubuntu installations only
so far. If your using BT3, its already in there, no worries.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Well, had a nice nine hour flight to Italy for business, figured this was as good of a time as
any to finally tackle the horrible looking output from a shell generated through SQL bruter. In
older versions the output from the shell was spitting out raw SQL data from the underlying operating
system. It looked pretty bad, almost unreadable. I finally cleaned it up and looks like a normal
shell now. This wasn't an easy feat, I had to break up the array to a string then use regular
expressions to parse through each line and replace bogus characters and do normal formatting. This
has been a known issue since the birth of Fast-Track, I'm very excited that its finally looking 
great. Enjoy.
* Small change, I dynamically generate the version numbers now in menu and command line mode, before
you may have noticed it said Version 3 and never changed with different versions. Now its showing
the correct version numbers every update.
* Changed the changelog.txt and credits.txt to CREDITS and CHANGELOG. Also modified credits to be
up to date.
* Fixed a bug where going to About in menu mode would cause Fast-Track to crash.
* Added error handling if Fast-Track Web GUI if the port was already in use.
* Removed the Shikata Ga Nai encoding from Fast-Track's SQLPWNAGE, it was causing issues
on some systems with corruptable executabls. 
* Added better cleanup in SQLPwnage to remove H2B files as soon as the conversion to binary
is completed.
* Added a "browse" button to the wordlist specification in sql bruter and in binary to hex generator.
Before you had to manually specify the wordlist or file to convert, now you just hit the browse button
and navigate to it.
* Changed the timeout with no internet connection for identifying an IP address to 2 seconds instead of
the default of 8 on SQLPwnage.
* Changed the directories where SQLPwnage does its conversions from binary to hex to the appdata folder.
My plan is to make all information go into the appdata folder and noowhere else. A lot easier for cleanup.
* Created a "version" directory in bin that handles what version number Fast-Track is on for the menu mode
and command line mode.
* Added some cool stuff to the SQL Bruter, once a system gets popped with the "sa" account, Fast-Track will
now allow you to specify what type of payload you want. For example, you can use the normal command shell
but we also incorporated the 64kb debug bypass attack that uploads a metasploit reverse vnc or reverse
meterpreter to the system without having to upload anything. Pretty slick feature that I haven't seen in
any SQL bruters before.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed a small issue in SQLPwnage when PyMills and BeautifulSoup was not installed it would throw
an exception and wasn't properly being handled correctly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.4.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added SSL support for SQLPwnage, the subnet scan DOES NOT support SSL yet,
but the crawlers for both blind and error based do. This is experimental, code
cleanup is needed in the future.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.4.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed a bug in SQL Injector manual setup causes a crash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 3.4.7

/tools/exploits/framework*/, if not it will exit that option.
* Added some extra carriage returns to fix confusion around some exploits with autopwn.
* Fixed a bug where in SQL Bruter it would say there was no internet connection detected
and you had an internet connection.
* Fixed where the Fast-Track GUI wasn't mapping correctly to the "exploits" section.
* Added two exploits I wrote when focusing on buffer overflows, the two new ones are
the Goodtech, rewritten as universal, and the Quicktime RTSP exploit.
* Kept same version, minor bug fix (thanks rbg) with metasploit mass client
* Fixed a quick bug in error handling in SQL bruter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
