BUG FIX LOG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed erroring out messages where SQL Injector would get a site it
couldn't exploit and would error out.

- Fixed where duplicate IP addresses would show in SQL Bruter

- With the new implementation of the UDP advanced footprinting, there
was a minor issue where the file used to pull the compromised sql servers
within Fast-Track wouldn't close properly. I added a filewries.close() to
make sure the file is terminated properly before continuing to properly
open and parse the data. This applies to both sqlbrute quick and sqlbrute
wordlist.

- Fixed minor issue with UDP footprinting where multiple IP addresses were
found it would append the IPADDR and PORT number to the attack string and
not brute force properly

- Fixed some update errors and old os.popen warning messages. Switched
to subprocess.Popen which is a newer and better method for OS system calls.

- Fixed a couple minor bugs with SQL bruter

- Fixed a bug where SQL Bruter would not properly brute force the SQL server
due to a bug in FreeTDS. Special thanks Andrew Weidenheimer aka Leroy from 
SecureState for finding this bug and finding the fix.

- Fixed SQLPwnage where it wouldn't auto fill in the forms and throw an 
exception in the wrong form parameter. 

- Fixed a navigation error in the nav pane for updates.
