Fast-Track installation guide:

To install Fast-Track simply check out the SVN repository at:

svn co http://svn.thepentest.com/fasttrack 

This will check out the latest Fast-Track revision. After that
you will need to install the necessary requirements for Fast-Track.

To do this, go to the Fast-Track root and type:

python setup.py install

Follow the instructions and you should be all set. If there is error
messages when loading Fast-Track saying you don't have the right
requirements, hit y or yes in order to attempt to automatically
install those. If that doesn't work you will need to manually
install the required packages in order for Fast-Track to work 
properly.
