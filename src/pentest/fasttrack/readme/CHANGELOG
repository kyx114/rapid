 Update 4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to Fast-Track Version 4.0, there has been a slew
of changes between version 3 and version 4. This version
is primarily focused on bug fixes, web interface rehaul,
documentation, code cleanup, and a heavy focus on the
exploits section. There are way to many changes to list
with this version however, below are some of the major
highlights.

- Completely redesigned web interface. Web interface design
by RBG.

- Code cleanup, a lot of things are dynamically
generated now and code reuse is becoming more and more
common.

- Better functionality of the web interface and allowing
easier understanding.

- Massive documentation campaign is underway to document
all aspects of Fast-Track, customizations, and various
other avenues.

- Improved Metasploit Autopwn Automated, sleeps 15 seconds
after exploiting the system(s) and then does a sessions -l
to list all sessions active, and gives you friendly 
reminders.

- Rewrote Metasploit Mass Client Attack to dynamically 
import all of the exploits now, much easier to update
and includes every single browser exploit for Metasploit.

script that was used in the past. Much more efficent and
reliable.

tie in to the Metasploit Framework to simplify some 
Metasploit payload creation.

it into Fast-Track to allow UDP identification of SQL
