  <td><p>This portion is fairly easy, when SQL installs it generally installs on port 1433. This
tool connects to that port in an attempt to brute force the specific "sa" account. Fast-Track will
automatically attempt to elevate your rights to "sa" if it isn't already obtained, in addition, in
MSSQL Server 2005 the xp_cmdshell stored procedure is disabled, Fast-Track will automatically re-enable
it for you. Once this has occured, you have several options for payload delivery including reverse
VNC injection, meterpreter, and reverse shells.<br><br>
If you scan multiple subnets, Fast-Track will list all individual systems compromised and will allow
you to interact with each one. For example, if there are three SQL servers that were compromised you would
see the following:
<br><br>
The following SQL Servers were compromised:<br>
1. 192.168.1.10<br>
2. 192.168.2.43<br>
3. 10.10.1.55<br>
<br>
Enter the server to interact with:
<br><br>
By specifying the number, i.e. 1 or 2 or 3 would jump you into whatever payload you specify next.  
<br><br>
There are two options, the first "quick brute" attempts a pretty quick password list which has about
fifty passwords it attempts.
<br><br>
The second is a wordlist brute, you can specify one host or a range and import a dictionary
to brute force with.
<br><br>
The MSSQL Bruter supports multiple subnets i.e. class A's, class B's, and so on and so forth. You can
also specifiy individual IP addresses. It uses the nmap syntax when performing the port scans.
<br><br>
Select which option you want to perform below, the MSSQL Quick Brute or the MSSQL Wordlist Brute.<br><br>
