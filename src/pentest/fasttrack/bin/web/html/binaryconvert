Binary to Hex conversion techniques utilize a method that allows you to delivery payloads on a remote operating
system without a "stager". The basic concept is this: Convert an executable to a specific hexadecimal format and
use the windows debug (built in by default) to convert our payloads from hex back to a binary. It is actually a
pretty easy technique to accomplish.
<br><br>
In most compromises a FTP answer file, or TFTP is used to grab our executables from the remote systems. What if
egress filtering becomes problematic? UDP isn't allowed and either is FTP. We need a way to get our payload onto
the system without executing an "egress" or outbound connection to the internet. That's where the conversion
technique comes into play. We echo a file on the operating system, this can be done through various methods,
Fast-Track utilizes this technique through SQL Injection, SQL queries, and various other methods but if you 
currently have write access to the operating system, you can use this method. 
<br><br>
There are some restrictions to this method, for one the payload has to be under 64KB. That is pretty big in
most cases however popular payloads like Meterpreter, reverse vnc payloads, and various others can tend to
be pretty big. You can use the stager version of these which is quite a bit smaller and will fit under the
64KB limit, but again, this relies off of egress connections to transfer our files.
<br><br>
The way this tool works within Fast-Track is it takes your executable, whatever it may be and puts it into
the right format to echo onto the operating system. It then uses the windows debug technique to convert our
hex back to a proper executable. You simply need to execute it now. Simply browse to your executbale, hit
convert, and check the Fast-Track root directory for the text file. Then if you have a command shell, or
write access to the operating system, paste the information in that text file onto the operating system
and watch the magic work.
