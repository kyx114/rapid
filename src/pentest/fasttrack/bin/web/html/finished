Fast-Track is currently attacking/updating the system, check the command shell for further information.
If the command window has already closed, then the attack was unsuccessful. Better luck next time.
<br><br>
There are plans in the near future to add log files as well as output of the failed attempt in order
to help further explain why the attack was unsuccessful. Coming soon to a theatre near you...
