<br>Metasploit Autopwn is a feature within Metasploit that is rich with different options.
<br>Autopwn allows you to NMAP scan a host, and automatically run exploits
<br>against the open ports on the system. So to break it down in simplistic terms, a port
<br>scan is ran against multiple hosts or one target, once those ports have been identified,
<br>metasploit will pull what exploits it have for those open ports, it may be 0 it may be
<br>30. Those exploits are then launches against the system you scanned. It's really a brute
<br>force of exploits, it doesn't know what version is being run on the system it just blindly
<br>launches a ton of exploits at the system.
<br>
<br>Additionally, you can do various other things like import nessus scans, etc.
<br>
<br>This feature runs the autopwn feature of Metasploit for you, including setting up the database,
<br>creating it, launching the scans, and exploiting the systems.
<br>
<br>When Metasploit has finished, type sessions -l to list successful shells. If nothing is listed, you were unsuccessful.
<br>
<br>Sessions -i will jump you into the successful shells.
<br>
<br>Note, sometimes a specific Apache exploit will run, if you notice Metasploit not responding, it has finished, just hit return and should get a msf> prompt.
<br>
<br>Some additional examples you can pop into the form field here is:
<br>
<br>-PN (iprange)
<br>-PN 192.168.1.1-254
<br>-P0 (iprange)
<br> 192.168.1.1/24
<br>
<br>Pretty much any NMap syntax you can think of you can use here.
