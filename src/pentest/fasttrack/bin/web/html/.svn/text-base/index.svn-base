           <p class="box_text">For those of you new to Fast-Track, it is a compliation of custom developed tools that allow penetration testers the ease of advanced penetration techniques in a relatively easy manner. Some of these tools utilize the Metasploit framework in order to successfully create payloads, exploit systems, or interface within compromised systems. During a penetration test on a Fortune 500, I realized that there wasn't many tools out there that did what I needed them to do, or they were just really horrible. Fast-Track tries to fill the void in some of the techniques I would normally use in a given penetration test. It is always good to learn how to do all of these attacks manually.</p>
