General Functionality and Movement in Fast-Track Tutorial
********************************************************************

Let's first start off with menus, if you've navigated to here, you
probably already know how to enter each menu. If you are in a menu
or are in the middle of a specific function in Fast-Track, you can
hit Control-C, which will bring you to the main menu. You can do
this anywhere in Fast-Track at anytime to return to the main menu.

The menu driven style is fairly new to "hacking" tools out there,
however, combining a ton of tools into one is always confusing on
what to use how to use it and generally is frustrating. I decided
to go more menu driven on this then a command line type deal that
you generally see.
