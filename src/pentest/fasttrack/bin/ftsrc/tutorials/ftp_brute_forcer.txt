FTP Brute Forcer: Requirements PExpect
***********************************************************************

Not really much to explain here, this is a simple brute forcer I wrote
one night while bored. It's not threaded so it might run a little slow.

It attempts to guess passwords from a predefined wordlist that you
specify. Once a password has been determined, it automatically logs
you in and drops you to interactive so you can identify whats on the
specific system.
