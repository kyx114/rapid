SQL 1433 Hacking: Requirements: PYMSSQL, FreeTDS
**********************************************************************

Alright, lets first start off with those of you that are unfamilar with
hacking port 1433. 1433 is Microsoft's default port installtion for
MSSQL. This goes for any version of SQL, by default it installs on 1433
and is used for primary means of community for SQL Servers. If a website
uses a back-end database to store information, the web server actually
talks back to the SQL server via port 1433. 

The way Fast-Track attacks this specific port is through a "brute force"
attack, or attempting to guess the initial password. When first installing
a SQL server, the administrator is asked if they would like to use 
Integrated Windows Authentication, use SQL Authentication, or use Mixed
Mode (a combination of both). Generally web applications are easy to use
SQL authentication then mixed or integrated. 

When going through the default installation of Microsoft SQL Server, there
needs to be a password for the "sa" account which Microsoft automatically
creates when installing the application. This "sa" account or "Systems
Administrator" account has full access over the database, as well as runs
under the "SYSTEM" account, which if your familar with Windows, has 
administrative rights over the machine.

When administrators generally install SQL Servers, they use weak passwords
that are generally easy to guess. The tool itself attempts to guess the 
password, and then use whats called a stored procedure (a built in function
of SQL) called xp_cmdshell. The xp_cmdshell stored procedure is installed
by default on SQL 2000/2005 but is disabled by default on 2005. I've added
an enable function in the menu that enables it for you just in case its
been disabled.

The xp_cmdshell stored procedure is the same thing as a command prompt. It
allows you to execute system level commands on the system itself. With this
your able to do some badddddddd stuff.

Alright, now onto what the tool can do. Fast-Track can brute force either
using a small list it has built into the code, or you can import your own
wordlist. Be careful when brute forcing SQL servers, as this generally flags
an alert in intrusion prevention and detection systems. Generally the quick
brute force method will allow you to go un-detected.

If you happen to guess the "sa" password, it is trivial in Fast-Track to spawn
a shell. Simply go to the spawn a shell in the Fast-Track menu and enter the
username and password that Fast-Track guessed. Right now the shells pretty
ugly, I plan on updating it to look more like a clean shell, but as for right now
its not one hundred percent.
