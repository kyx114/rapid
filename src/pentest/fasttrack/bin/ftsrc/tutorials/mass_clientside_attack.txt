Mass Client-Side Attack
***********************************************************************

Requirements: PExpect

Pretty simple stuff here, I took a couple of the most recent and popular
client-side exploits from Metasploit... First thing Fast-Track does is
start up Apache by default. It then replaces the index.html located
within /var/www/htdocs/ with a new file that has iframes imbedded inside.

Metasploit is then launched on ports ranging in the 8000 range. Simply
have a vulnerable server connect to you and it does a basic generic_bind
shell on that specific host. It tries a multitude of different exploits..
