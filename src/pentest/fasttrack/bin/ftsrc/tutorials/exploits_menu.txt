Some exploits that get written in Python I will be putting into the
tool as much as I can. All you will simply need to do is enter the 
IP address you want to attack, and it will launch netcat based on
whatever the exploits states and get a shell back to you. Right now
theres only a few exploits available, will be adding more soon.

More to come....
