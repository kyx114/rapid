Automatic MetaSploit AutoPWN Function: Requirements: PExpect
**********************************************************************

Metasploit 3 allows you to use a function called db_autopwn.

Autopwn in a basic nutshell port scans systems for open ports, based
on which ports are open, Metasploit automatically launches exploits
based on port numbers. It doesn't do advanced fingerprinting or launch
exploits based on operating system or what is running on that port. It
just launches a slew of exploits at a specific host if that port is 
in-fact open.

Generally, when using this, there is a series of commands you have to
issue, for example db_load sqlite3, db_nmap ipaddy, db_autopwn -p -t -e
and so on and so forth. I've made a quick script that automates all of
this for you using a python module called PExpect. Basically, you only
have to specific your database your using, and generally this is going
to be sqlite3 (needs to be installed from the update menu!) and the ip
addresses you want to attack, and it does everything for you. Remember,
on the IP addresses, you can use a range, anything that is acceptable
to NMap.

Once all exploits have finished, you can use sessions -l to list any
successful shells that were spawned on a specific exploit.

To jump to a specific shell, type sessions -i <id> to jump to that 
specific shell and into the machine you just popped.
