How to update Fast-Track: Requirements: None
********************************************************************

When you initially start Fast-Track, it automatically contacts our
servers and attempts to pull updates using MD5 hashing. If an
update is available, it will prompt you to install the latest version
or not. Once the update occurs, you will need to restart Fast-Track
in order for the updates to take effect.

Quite a few of the modules and tools that I've built into Fast-Track
require specific modules that are not found in a default installation
of Back|Track. As such, you will need to update Fast-Track in the
updates menu in order to unlock the functionality of the other tools.

These tools are generally designated (needed for such and such) to let
you know you do need this if you want to use a specific function.
