What is this?
-------------

theHarvester is a tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers). Is a really simple tool, but very effective for the early stages of a penetration test.

The actual sources are:

google: google search engine  - www.google.com
google-profiles: google search engine, specific search for Google profiles
bing: microsoft search engine  - www.bing.com
bingapi: microsoft search engine, through the API (you need to add your Key in the discovery/bingsearch.py file)
pgp: pgp key server - pgp.rediris.es 
exalead: Exalead search engine  - www.exalead.com
linkedin: google search engine, specific search for Linkedin users

Dependencies:
------------
none

Changelog in 2.0:
----------------
-Complete rewrite, more modular and easy to maintain
-New sources (Exalead, Google-Profiles, Bing-Api)
-Time delay between request, to prevent search engines from blocking our IPÂ´s
-You can start the search from the results page that you want, hence you can *resume* a search 
-Export to xml
-All search engines harvesting
