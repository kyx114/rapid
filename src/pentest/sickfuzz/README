NOTE: sickfuzz will run even without the SPIKE tweaking made by the setup.py file, but it will not run correctly so you may encounter different issues/errors.

* To get sickfuzz ready and tweak the SPIKE fuzzing framework simply run the setup.py file:
      
      python setup.py
      python sickfuzz.py
